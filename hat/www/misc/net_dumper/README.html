<h2>
Dump Generator Program
</h2>

<p>
One feature of the JVM is that you can request a heap dump over 
a socket. This can be useful for remote debugging of devices that 
don't have file systems, for example. To use this feature, you 
run a program that listens on a port on some machine (call it 
port 7001 on "fido"), and then you invoke the JVM like this:
</p>
<pre>
    java -Xrunhprof:net=fido:7001,format=b com.something.MyProgram
</pre>
<p>
The JVM then connects to port 7001 on fido, and that program can send 
it a command to generate a heap dump.
<p>
I wrote a quick hack to request these dumps. It's called NetDumper, 
and you can download it <a href="NetDumper.java">here.</a>
