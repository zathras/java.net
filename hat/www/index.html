<strong><font color="ff0000">HAT has now been included with Java SE.</font></strong>
    Starting with Java SE 6, HAT has been replaced with jhat, which
    is included with the standard Sun
    distribution.  HAT is 
    not being maintained in a stand-alone configuration.  Source code
    for jhat is available with the current release of Java SE.

<p>
As of this writing, Java SE 6 ("Mustang") is the current version,
so the most recent version of jhat can be found at the Mustang
product page at 
<a href="https://mustang.dev.java.net/">https://mustang.dev.java.net/</a>.
More background can be found in three blog entries,
<a href="http://blogs.sun.com/roller/page/alanb?entry=heap_dumps_are_back_with">here</a>,
<a href="http://blogs.sun.com/roller/page/sundararajan?entry=querying_java_heap_with_oql">here</a> and
<a href="http://weblogs.java.net/blog/kellyohair/archive/2005/09/heap_dump_snaps.html">here</a>.
The page you're reading now has the old version of HAT, which it is obsolete;
we recommend using the improved version in Java SE.  The old version of
HAT is mostly of historical interest.

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
The Heap Analysis 
Tool (HAT) helps to debug unnecessary object retention (sometimes called
&quot;memory leaks&quot;) by providing a convenient 
means to browse the object topology in a heap snapshot, which is generated by 
the Java VM.  HAT reads a hprof file, then sets itself up as a web 
server--therefore allowing you to run queries against a heap dump contained 
within the hprof file.

A complete description of the capabilities of the tool is given in
<a href="doc/README.html">the README file.</a>

<strong>Note:</strong> 
        This is not a product.
The Heap Analysis Tool is part of a research and development project and is 
being released as interesting, but unsupported, technology that may be
of use as a debugging aid for Java developers.

<p>
To install, pick a directory where you'd like to
install hat, and unzip the zip file (either hat_bin.zip
or hat_src.zip).  There's a bin directory that contains a
shell script and a batch file for launching; you might
want to copy these where you install software on your
system.  I use ~/bin on my Mac and c:/bin on PCs.  You
might need to edit the startup script to point to the
hat.jar file that contains the program binary.

<h2>Miscellaneous</h2>
<p>
A little utility called "NetDumper" lets you grab a heap dump
from a remote JVM.  It's described <a href="misc/net_dumper/README.html">
