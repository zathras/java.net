<h2>Cafe-blu project home page</h2>
<p>Cafe-blu is a meeting place for BD-J specification issue 
discussions. This project is open to BD-J specification experts, device
manufacturers and content developers. </p>
<p>Get in touch with the experts, exchange information, share 
example code, find out what works and what doesn't in BD-J.
</p>
<p>
Discussion topics will include (but should not be limited to) 
specification interpretation issues, content authoring, device
issues and conformance testing.  It's usually bad form to mention a
specific player by name, though, and it might violate the terms of your
NDA.
</p>
<h2>Welcome!</h2>  
<p>Welcome to the Cafe-blu project!</p>    
<p>You may to subscribe to the mailing list, browse the archives 
by clicking the nav bar links.</p>
<p>Note that access to these pages is by invitation of one of
the major studios.  Access is futher restricted to companies 
that have valid access to the Blu-ray specifications, part 3.
This includes BDA board members, BDA contributor members, BDA 
FLLA licensees, and companies that have signed the BDA information 
agreement, and purchased a copy of the 3-2 specification. This 
forum is for companies and individuals that are developing BD-J 
related products, or are exploring the possibility of doing 
business with the format.</p>
<p>
Primarily, this group consists of the BD-J discussion forum.  You
can get to that by clicking "forums" on the left, or directly
<a href="https://cafe-blu.dev.java.net/servlets/ForumMessageList?forumID=2790">here</a>.
There's also an issue tracking database.  Sun may use this to more
formally track specific specification issues.  If anyone else would like
to do that too, we'd welcome it, but in that case please assign the
issue to yourself.  When discussions reveal a spec issue, Sun (Michael
or Bill) will endeavor to add them to the database, and find the best
path for communicating them to 2/8.
</p>
<h3>Membership Policies</h3>
<p>
Because the membership of this group is restricted, it's necessary
that we make a good faith effort to ensure that access really is
restricted to people who have a legitimate copy of the BD-ROM spec,
part 3.  To that end, we ask each company to identify a primary
contact.  Once a month, that primary contact will be asked to
verify that all of the accounts under that company are still valid
for current employees.
</p>
<p>
Anonymous postings are OK.  If you'd like to post anonymously, please
make up a java.net ID that doesn't identify you or your company, and 
have your company's primary contact ask us (at 
<a href="mailto:bill.foote@sun.com">bill.foote@sun.com</a>) to add that 
user ID into the project.  I won't disclose the mapping of user IDs to 
company, even within Sun.
