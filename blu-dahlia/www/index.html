Blu-Dahlia had an initial two meetings, but never went beyond that.
We'll keep the original page contents here, and it is a cute name, so
maybe we'll do something with it in the future.

<h2>Welcome!</h2>
<p>
Welcome to Blu-Dahlia!
<b>Blu-Dahlia</b> is a California-based user's group for developers 
of <b>Blu-Ray Java</b> applications, and applications for other GEM TV 
platforms, such as OCAP and MHP and GEM-IPTV. We plan to have meetings 
both in LA and SF, with a shared e-mail list.  We'll have a <b>launch
event</b> in Los Angeles on March 7, 2007, and our San Francisco
launch on March 8, 2007.  See
<a href="http://blogs.sun.com/semug/">http://blogs.sun.com/semug/</a>
for details and registration information.

Like the nightclub in Raymond Chandler's 1946 movie, the Blu-Dahlia Java 
SIG is a place to exchange ideas and best practices among professionals. 
We may not have Veronica Lake, but we do intend to be an open group for 
the sharing of best practices in application development, including 
tools, techniques, frameworks, and shared code. Meetings may be held 
bi-weekly or monthly, in an oasis of calm somewhere in this teeming 
city of angels (and in SF, too!).

<h2>Links of Intererst to the Community</h2>
<b>HD Cookbook</b>In support of an upcoming book, there will be a website
with pointers to resources of interest at
<a href="http://hdcookbook.com/">http://hdcookbook.com</a>.  It is hoped
that this will soon include a pointer to a java.net project with a
source code repository of framework(s) and interesting Java code for
Blu-Ray and Television in general.  One component of this will be a framework
called GRIN; see hdcookbook.com for details.
